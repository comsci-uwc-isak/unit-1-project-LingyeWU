Planning

**Defining the problem (Tpoic 1.1.1)** 

A computer program for purpose of recording information about their orders is needed by a car rental office. The comapany is specifically interested in building a program to collect basic information about the distance driven for each car. Stakeholders in this process include hardware, software, people working with it or using it and the immediate environment. In this case specially, the problem accompanies with client reqiurements including a simple terminal based program; a simple and transparent installation, etc. At this stage, a feaisbility study report should be conducted, which includes factors: 
1. Technical feasibility: the existing technology is SUFFICIENT to implement the proposed system.
2. Economic feasibility: Owing to the nature of the program being a simple terminal-based program, it is cost effective.
3. Legal feasibility: As a car rental company, it is their right to record the distance a car from their company drives.
4. Operational feasibility: This needs to be tested out after the program is built.
5. Schedule feasibility: It will take (max.) 4 weeks to build the entire thing.
